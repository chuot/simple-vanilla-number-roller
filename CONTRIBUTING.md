## Bugs and feature requests

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chuot/simple-vanilla-number-roller/issues) to track bugs and feature requests.

Open an [issue](https://github.com/chuot/simple-vanilla-number-roller/issues) that best describes the bug or feature request.

For **feature requests**, describe the reason and use case.

Most of the time, the issue will be assigned to the [owner and project manager](https://github.com/chuot) and then resolved in a timely manner. In some cases, the issue will be identified as _help needed_ and then assigned to a volonteer contributor. Again, pull requests will be rejected if they are not related to a previously opened and assigned issue.
